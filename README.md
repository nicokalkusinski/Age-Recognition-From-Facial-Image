# Age Recognition From Facial Image
University project focused on predicting age of a person basing on the facial image. Works best with images with aspect ratio 1:1. The project is ready to be deployed; originally deployed on AWS.

### Files description
| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Model_DL_ktrain.ipynb | Main file with setting up and training |
| PredictingCode.ipynb | Code needed when wants to predicts the age from the picture |
| Generate test sample.ipynb | Generating the test sample out of our dataset |
| accuracyPresentation.ipynb | Shows the graphs on the accuracy assessments |
| grading_sample.txt | txt file with paths to the images used as our grading accuracy sample |
| rename.py | Used to rename the images in the folders |

### How to run it
To make a prediction with the model, first make sure you have ktrain, tensorflow, and pandas installed. Then, run the predicting code jupyter notebook. Feel free to change the file path to the picture you want.
