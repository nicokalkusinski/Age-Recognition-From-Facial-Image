Age estimation from facial images has gained significant attention due to its numerous applications in security, 
surveillance, and human-computer interaction. As technology progresses,
it gains the ability to do things that only people could do just years before. 
When will a computer’s ability to predict pass the average person’s for complex tasks, 
like guessing someone’s age? We will build an application that uses a model for age recognition built from deep learning. 
The main purpose of this project is to see how accurate that model can be.
The average person has an error rate of eight years when guessing a random person’s age according to Colin et al. 
Will our model be able to surpass that rate?
